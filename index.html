	<h3>General Info</h3>
	<p>Recycling refers to turning waste into a usable material.
		Most large cities distribute recycling bins for residents. The following materials CAN be recycled:</p>

	<p>Metals, paper/cardboard, plastics, glass, batteries/bulbs, electronics</p>
	<p>Explore the <a href="http://www.wm.com/us/facility-locator/recycling">waste management</a> website to find recycling drop-off
		locations near you and learn more about recycling!</p>
	<p>Composting food scraps can be beneficial but if done incorrectly it can be really hazardous if you’re misinformed
		and add things that aren’t supposed to be there. Refer to the guide below to make sure you’re
		composting the right way: <a href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/compost-correctly-78338.html">How to Compost Correctly</a></p>
	<p><b>Upcycle</b>: reuse (discarded objects or material) in such a way as to create a product of a higher quality
		or value than the original.</p>
	<p><b>Thrift Shop</b>: a store selling secondhand clothes and other household goods,
		typically to raise funds for a charitable institution.</p>
	<p><b>Consignment Shop</b>: a store that sells second-hand items (typically clothing and accessories) on
		behalf of the original owner, who receives a percentage of the selling price.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Red Flags</b></p>
	<p>We want to make sure that you are donating responsibly and ethically! These are some places that should be avoided:</p>
	<p><b>The salvation army</b> has been known to be anti-LGBT, and no one should be supporting or
		spreading that kind of message.</p>
	<p>“In recent years, the Salvation Army has come under fire for its lengthy history of anti-LGBT political
		maneuvering and other incidents. The church has
		publicly articulated its belief that homosexuality is unacceptable”
		(Zinnia Jones, Huffington Post) Read the article here:
		<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zinnia-jones/the-salvation-armys-histo_b_4422938.html">Salvation Army Article</a></p>

	<p><b>Clothes Donation Boxes</b></p>
	<p>“The receptacles typically have signs that indicate donated goods will go to the poor or, in some cases, to
		legitimate charities. But, city officials said, the needy do not benefit from much of what is collected.
		Instead, the clothing is often sold in thrift stores or in bulk overseas, with the proceeds going to
		for-profit entities that can be impossible to trace, or even to contact.” (David Gonzalez, NY Times)

		We want to find better ways to reuse items before throwing them away and to encourage smarter decisions when disposing of and donating items.
		Being women of color, it was also important for us to find the ways in which people from developing countries and indigenous communities conserved
